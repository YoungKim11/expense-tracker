# expense-tracker


Hi this is a simple expense tracker that I made by following a tutorial made by Brad Traversy over at traversymedia.

# Steps to running the expense tracker

In order to run the app you need to enter -> npm run dev

To add an expense simply add a - infront of the amount you wish to add as an expense i.e: "-400" 

To remove an ammount click on the red x under history
